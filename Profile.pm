# Dost thou love life? Then do not squander time
#   -- Benjamin Franklin

# start as:
#   env PERL5DB='BEGIN{require "src/Profile.pm"}' perl -d program.pl
#   or: perl -d:Profile program.pl
# data gets saved in 'prof.out'

# motivation:
#   Devel::DProf appears to have issues. when it is used
#     9 times out of 10 it produces output that is unusable by dprofpp (even with -F)
#     the statistics are often obviously wrong
#     it causes crashage
# of course, this code isn't really any better....

=head1 NAME

Devel::Profile - tell me why my perl program runs so slowly

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    perl -d:Profile program.pl
    less prof.out

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Devel::Profile package is a Perl code profiler.
This will collect information on the execution time of a Perl script and of the subs in that script.
This information can be used to determine which subroutines are using the most time and which
subroutines are being called most often.

To profile a Perl script, run the perl interpreter with the -d debugging switch.
The profiler uses the debugging hooks.
So to profile script test.pl the following command should be used:

	perl -d:Profile test.pl  

When the script terminates (or periodicly while running, see ENVIRONMENT) the profiler will dump
the profile information to a file called F<prof.out>. This file is human-readable, no
additional tool is required to read it.

Note: Statistics are kept per sub, not per line.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

=over 4

=item C<PERL_PROFILE_SAVETIME>

How often to save profile data while running, in seconds, 0 to save only at exit.
The default is every 2 minutes.

=item C<PERL_PROFILE_FILENAME>

Filename to save profile data to, default is F<prof.out>

=item C<PERL_PROFILE_DONT_OTHER>

Time spent running code not in 'subs' (such as naked code in main) won\'t
get accounted for in the normal manner. By default, we account for this time
in the sub '<other>'. With this variable set, we leave it as 'missing' time.
This reduces the effective runtime of the program, and the calculated percentages.

=head1 LONG RUNNING PROGRAMS

This module was written so that the author could profile a large long-running
(daemon) program. Since normally, this program never exited, saving profiling
data only at program exit was not an interesting option. This module will save
profiling data periodically based on $PERL_PROFILE_SAVETIME, or the program
being profiled can call C<DB::save()> at any time. This allows you to watch
your profiling data while the program is running.

The above program also had a very large startup phase (reading config files,
building data structures, etc), the author wanted to see profiling data
for the startup phase, and for the running phase seperately. The running
program can call C<DB::reset()> to save the profiling data and reset the
statistics. Once reset, only "stuff" that happens from that point on will be
reflected in the profile data file.

By default, reset is attached to the signal handler for C<SIGUSR2>.
Using a perl built with "safe signal handling" (5.8.0 and higher),
you may safely send this signal to control profiling.

=head1 BUT I WANT INCLUSIVE TIMES NOT EXCLUSIVE TIMES

=head1 BUGS

Some buggy XS based perl modules can behave erroneously when
run under the perl debugger. Since Devel::Profile uses the perl
debugger interfaces, these modules will also behave erroneously
when being profiled.
    
There are no known bugs in this module.
